Next, we will look into a method to represent the Hamiltonian of the system in form of a square matrix (matrix representation of the Hamiltonian operator) and use the matrix representation to numerically obtain energy eigen-states and eigen-values of the system. The results of the computation can be verified with our knowledge about the solution of the systems\n",
